# tomtom-use-case-turf-integration

This sample application shows you how to integrate TomTom Maps SDK for Web with Turf.js and use some of its features. Turf.js is an open source library for geospatial analysis. By using Turf.js with this use case you can: 

* Learn how to display a well-defined and limited area (in our example: Amsterdam) on the map.

* Find out how to check if some points are located within or outside of the area (polygon).
